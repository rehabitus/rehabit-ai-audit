  {
    q: "I'm not technical. Will I understand the report?",
    a: "Absolutely. The entire report is written in plain English with clear visuals. No jargon, no code, no acronyms. If you can read a menu, you can read this report. We also walk through it live with you on a call.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if AI doesn't work for my type of business?",
    a: "That's exactly what the audit determines. If we find that automation won't deliver ROI for a specific process, we tell you — and we tell you why. We'd rather save you money than sell you something that won't work. That said, in every audit we've conducted, we've found significant savings.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from just using ChatGPT?",
    a: "ChatGPT is a general tool. It doesn't know your business, your workflows, your clients, or your numbers. We analyze YOUR specific operation, match solutions to YOUR specific problems, and calculate ROI with YOUR actual data. The Digital Twin is trained on YOUR content — it's not generic AI.",
  },
  {
    q: "I've been burned by consultants before.",
    a: "We get it. That's why we structured this as a fixed-price, fixed-timeline, guaranteed engagement. You know exactly what you're getting, exactly when you're getting it, and exactly what it costs. If we don't deliver value, you get your money back.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is the audit priced so low?",
    a: "Because it won't stay low. The price increases by $100 after every 10 audits until it reaches its final value of $5,000–$10,000 — which is still below the industry standard of $5,000–$15,000 for an AI readiness assessment. Right now you're catching us early. 75% of audit clients move forward with implementation, so we'd rather earn your trust with results at a price that removes friction.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens after the audit?",
    a: "You get three clear options: Quick Wins (2 weeks, highest-impact automations), Foundation (6-8 weeks, core transformation), or Full Transformation (12-16 weeks, everything). You choose what fits your budget and timeline. Or you take the report and implement it yourself — it's yours either way.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is the Digital Twin different from a chatbot?",
    a: "A chatbot follows a script. Your Digital Twin is trained on your actual methodology, your content library, your voice, and your frameworks. It doesn't give generic answers — it gives YOUR answers. It cites YOUR sources. It sends people back to YOUR content. And it keeps learning as you publish new material.",
