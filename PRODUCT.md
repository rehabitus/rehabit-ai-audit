# Rehabit 4C AI Coaching OS — Product Context

## The 4C Framework

The "4C" defines who we serve. Our ICP must meet all four criteria:

| C | Name | Definition |
|---|------|------------|
| **1st C** | **Conscious** | Focus on mindset, awareness, personal transformation — not just tactics. Works in coaching, personal development, health, relationships, or any field where inner change drives outer results. |
| **2nd C** | **Creative** | Already creating content — YouTube channel, podcast, community, book, or course. Has a methodology and a voice worth amplifying. |
| **3rd C** | **Connected** | Has traction: $500k–$5M annual revenue, 5k–500k subscribers/followers. Not building from zero — scaling from proof. |
| **4th C** | **Coach** | Delivers recurring transformation — retainers, group programs, memberships. Not one-off info products. Client LTV matters to them. |

**Disqualifiers:** Solopreneurs with no audience, pure e-commerce, one-off course creators without a recurring coaching model, non-conscious niches (pure tactics/growth hacking).

## ICP Profile: The Scaling Coach

**Current reality:**
- 200–5,000 active clients
- Team of 2–25 people (or solo fractional leaders with 5+ high-ticket clients)
- Using: Kajabi, Teachable, Skool, Circle, Zoom, ActiveCampaign
- Annual revenue: $500k–$5M
- Audience: 5k–500k subscribers/followers
- Model: Recurring revenue (retainers, group coaching, memberships)

**Core pain:** Can't scale personalization without losing quality. As they grow, the human touch that made them great gets diluted. Clients churn. Leads aren't nurtured. Content is exhausting to produce.

**What they want:** To serve more people without burning out. To keep the soul of their work while systematizing the delivery.

## Audit Product: What's Included

### Standard Audit ($1,200 — Founding Member Rate)

1. **The Deep Dive** — 90-minute strategy session. Business model, bottlenecks, strengths, blind spots. Identifies where AI creates leverage *and* where it would strip away what clients love.

2. **AI Transformation Blueprint** — Comprehensive, prioritized roadmap specific to their business, capacity, and values. What to automate. What to protect. What to reimagine.

3. **The Humanity Map** — Unique to Rehabit. Explicitly identifies the human elements that AI should *never* replace. Shows how AI can make those elements stronger, not weaker.

4. **First AI Implementation** — One working AI workflow, automation, or tool deployed in their business before the engagement ends. They leave with momentum, not just a plan.

5. **30-Day Follow-Up** — Check-in call 30 days later.

### Pay-in-Full Bonus (included at $1,200)
**First Core AI System — delivered FREE** in the same 5-day window as the audit.

## Key Copy Assets

**Hero headline options (from Notion):**
- "Something Big Is Happening. You Get to Choose How You Meet It."
- "AI is rewriting every industry. The question isn't whether it will change your business — it's whether *you* will be the one directing that change."

**Core reframe:**
> "The people who will thrive aren't the ones who adopt AI fastest. They're the ones who adopt it most consciously."

**The Rehabit difference:**
> "Every other AI consultant will tell you to automate everything and move fast. That's not transformation. That's panic with a spreadsheet."
